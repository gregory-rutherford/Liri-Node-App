### How it works
In order to run this you will need your own .env file
with the proper spotify keys and secret data. Create your own keys/secret here:
https://developer.spotify.com/

Open the terminal and run `node liri.js`

You have 4 options
1. "spotify-this-song" 
    *If you do not enter a search it defaults to "The sign" by Ace of Base"

    *If you do enter a search it will dislay the song, the artist, a preview link, and the album the song appears on.
